# Joshua-G-Projects
Here are some projects I worked on in my data science class. These are both group projects where we all took turns coding, debugging, and writing. 
The first project looks at what factors might have predicted the outcome of the 2016 election using tree-based methods and k-nn. 
The second project looks at what factors might predict the fire risk of counties in California using a random forest model.
