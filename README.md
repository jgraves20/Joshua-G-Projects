# Joshua-G-Projects
Welcome! These are  group projects where we all took turns coding, debugging, and writing. 
The first project looks at what factors might have predicted the outcome of the 2016 election using tree-based methods and k-nn. 
The second project looks at what factors might predict the fire risk of counties in California using a random forest model.
I'm sure you've noticed that I haven't provided our group's code. This is because when the class is offered again at CMC, another group cannot
use our code and pass it off as their own for a grade. Although this is not quite in the GitHub spirit of collaboration, this is not only my project to share.
If you are a potential employer who really needs to see the code, I do have it readily available.
